Scala-99-Problems
=================
Just going through the [99 problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) and implementing a quick and dirty solution to them. My goal isn't to provide a robust solution, but to just to solve the core of the problem. Meaning, corner cases aren't expicitly considered, unless needed to get the output in the example.

For example, if you provide an empty list to some solutions, it may throw an exception.
